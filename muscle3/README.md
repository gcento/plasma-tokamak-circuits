# MUSCLE3 actor: plasmaless coil+vessel model

`muscle_plasmaless_actor.m` wraps the IMAS interface of the model (`../imas_model/`) as a
MUSCLE3 (libmuscle 0.10, Python in-process from MATLAB) actor. It stands in for NICE
direct evolutive (`nice_evo_rd`) in controller tests. In IMAS-PDS it is the program
`plasmaless` (`workflows/lib/local_programs.ymmsl`), used by the workflow
`plasmaless_controller`; PDS installs this repository into
`local_installs/plasmaless-tokamak-circuits` with `setup_files/setup_plasmaless.sh`.

## Ports

| Operator | Port | Content |
|---|---|---|
| F_INIT | `equilibrium_f_init` | multi-time equilibrium (reference trajectory); its message timestamp is the start time t0 |
| F_INIT | `pf_active_f_init` | multi-time pf_active, `homogeneous_time` 1, coil currents and voltages |
| S | `pf_active_s` | one-slice pf_active with the coil voltages at t (coil names not needed) |
| O_I | `equilibrium_o_i` | one-slice equilibrium at t (see below) |
| O_I | `pf_active_o_i` | one-slice coil currents at t (and the voltages applied over the step) |
| O_I | `pf_passive_o_i` | one-slice passive loop (vessel) currents at t |

Flag `KEEPS_NO_STATE_FOR_NEXT_USE`.

## Settings

- `dt` (mandatory): model time step [s] (discretisation of the model).
- `t_interval` (mandatory): exchange period [s]; must equal `dt`.
- `t_end` (mandatory): last output time [s]; t0 < `t_end` <= last time of the F_INIT
  equilibrium.
- `md_uri` (optional): IMAS URI of the DD4 machine description (`em_coupling`,
  `pf_active`, `pf_passive`). Default: `data/md_dd4` of this repository (derived from
  the actor file location), made with `tools/convert_md_dd3_to_dd4.py`.
- `linear_model_dir` (optional, default `''` = circuit model): absolute path of a
  directory holding `linear_model.json` and the matrices of an external linear model
  (`imas_model/configure_linear_model.m`, repository README "External linear model").
  The machine description is still read for the coil names and order.
- `operating_point` (optional, linear model only, default `descriptor`): which source
  wins for the operating point, `descriptor` or `f_init` (see below); any other value
  is the error `plasmaless_actor:settings`.

## External linear model: operating point

The linear model's states, inputs and outputs are deviations from its linearisation
point. The actor starts at t0 with x = 0 and builds the operating point from two
sources: the descriptor (`operating_point`: coil currents, voltages, outputs) and the
F_INIT data at t0 (`op.coil_current` and `op.voltage` = currents and voltages of the
F_INIT pf_active slice closest to t0 in model coil order, `op.y` = the observables found
in the F_INIT equilibrium slice closest to t0, `plasmaless_observables_from_equilibrium`).
Setting `operating_point`:

- `descriptor` (default): descriptor values win, F_INIT fills what the descriptor does
  not give. The absolute coil currents and Ip sent to the controller then start at the
  linearisation point, which differs from the F_INIT scenario values: the controller sees
  a step error at t0 (for the received model, Ip +15.06 MA against the scenario's).
- `f_init`: the coil currents, voltages and the observables found in the F_INIT data win;
  descriptor values are used only for what F_INIT does not have. The outputs start on
  the scenario, and the model's deviations are added to it.

A descriptor with `coordinates: absolute` (absolute states, e.g. the circuit model
exported as matrices) has no operating point: the actor starts it from the coil currents
of the F_INIT pf_active slice closest to t0 (passive states 0, as the circuit model),
ignores the setting `operating_point`, and prints one line saying so.

An observable known by neither source stays unknown and is not sent. Each step uses
du = V - `op.voltage`, so the operating point is held until the controller changes the
voltages; the actor prints one line naming the setting, how many coil entries came from
F_INIT, the observables taken from the F_INIT equilibrium, those sent as absolute
values and those not sent.
Outputs: `pf_active_o_i` = `op.coil_current` + deviations; `pf_passive_o_i` has as many
loops as the model has passive states (4 for the received model, `PS_1, PS_2, VV_1,
VV_2`), named as in the
descriptor; `equilibrium_o_i` = the reference pass-through plus the known observables
(`plasmaless_observables_to_equilibrium`: a known Ip overrides the pass-through ip;
magnetic axis, X-point (`contour_tree.node{1}`, `critical_type` 1) and gaps are added;
`boundary.geometric_axis` stays the reference pass-through because the model does not
give it; `Dist2ndSep` has no DD4 field and is not sent), with an `ids_properties.comment`
naming the model and the observables it provides.

## Timing

As `nice_imas_evo_rd_muscle3` (NICE 3.0.0.dev446, `main_imas_evo_rd_muscle3.cc`):
t0 = timestamp of `equilibrium_f_init`; the F_INIT pf_active is sliced at t0 (closest
sample). The first step uses those scenario voltages; each step gives the outputs at
t = t_prev + dt, sent on the three O_I ports with timestamp t and next_timestamp t + dt,
or None when t + dt > t_end + 1e-9 (then the actor stops). Otherwise the actor receives
`pf_active_s` (expected at timestamp t) and uses its voltages for the next step. The stop
decision comes from `t_end` only: the PDS controller always sends next_timestamp None.

## Assumptions

- Vessel (pf_passive loop) currents are zero at t0: the scenario data has none.
- The coils of the F_INIT pf_active and of the machine description are the same coils,
  in the same order (the controller works by index): the short names (CS3U ... PF6,
  VS3U, VS3L) must match exactly, otherwise the actor fails.
- The coil resistances come from the model machine description; the resistances sent
  by the controller are ignored.
- `equilibrium_o_i` has no plasma: `global_quantities.ip` and
  `boundary.geometric_axis.r/z` are the F_INIT equilibrium values linearly interpolated
  at t (so the controller's Ip/R/Z errors are zero), `code.output_flag` = 0, and
  `ids_properties.comment` says so.
- After the actor returns, the PDS launcher ends MATLAB with `os._exit(0)`: MATLAB
  R2025b with IMAS-MATLAB 5.6.0 segfaults on exit after reading an `imas:hdf5` entry.

## Test

Tested with a dummy controller in place of the PCS one (shot 105073 F_INIT, t0 = 84.3176 s,
with the former VSU/VSL name mapping,
20 steps): 20 exchanges, first output at t0 + 0.01, last with next_timestamp None, and
coil currents identical to direct `plasmaless_step_ids` calls.

Earlier test (historical, when the PDS workflow still ran `waveform_editor` inside the
workflow) for shot 105084: source and waveform_editor, dummy controller,
t0 = 136.2276 s, dt 0.005, t_end = t0 + 0.02: 4 exchanges; the F_INIT equilibrium and
pf_active received by the controller equal the NICE inverse output (`nice_out`) exactly.

In the current PDS `plasmaless_controller` workflow (IMAS-PDS,
`workflows/plasmaless_controller/`), the Waveform-Editor runs once at case creation
(`preprocess.sh`, writes `<case>/preprocess/initial_state` from `nice_out`); `source`
reads that entry and sends the F_INIT equilibrium and pf_active directly to
`magnetic_controller` and `plasmaless`, and a `recorder_plasmaless` component
(`visualization/plasmaless_currents.py`) shows live coil/passive-current figures in
m3dash. Slurm run with the PCS controller, shot 105084, t_end 160
(`cases/runs/plasmaless_controller_105084_20261008_200304`): 4754 exchanges, finished
without error.

Slurm run with the PCS controller and the external linear model (2026-10-14), shot 105073,
case `plasmaless_controller_105073` (override `cases/overrides/plasmaless_controller_105073.ymmsl`:
`source.t_min` 81.0 / `t_max` 100.0 on the inverse `nice_out` of
`metis_nice_inverse_from_dina_105073_20261014_102619`, t0 = 81.4576 s, `plasmaless.t_end`
83.4576, dt = `t_interval` 0.005, `plasmaless.linear_model_dir` =
`linearModelSimple_105073_t84.417598`, `plasmaless.operating_point` descriptor; `PLASMALESS_REPO`
exported at submission because the PDS local install predates the linear-model code), run dir
`cases/runs/plasmaless_controller_105073_20261014_103330`: finished without error, 6 instances
exit 0, 400 exchanges (81.4626 .. 83.4576 s), 17 states / 14 coils / 4 passive loops / 9
observables, operating point from the descriptor (0/0 coil entries from F_INIT), one expected
`plasmaless:inputUndriven` warning (VS1). Integration test only; the physics (CS/PF commands at
the clip from the first step, VS3 currents to -100 kA, rmag +16 cm) is discussed in
`../pds_integration.txt` 4.7.

## Standalone test

`plasmaless_standalone.ymmsl` couples the actor to `voltage_driver.py` only (no PDS, no
PCS controller): the driver sends a no-plasma F_INIT equilibrium and a cold-start
pf_active (machine-description coils, currents 0), then answers every output with the
voltage pulse train of `timeseries_plasmaless_model.m`, as `run_plasmaless_imas.m`
applies it (u(t_k) over [t_k, t_k+dt]). Settings: `dt` = `t_interval` = 0.01,
`t_end` = 28; the run script adds `driver.md_uri` and `driver.results_file` with absolute
repository paths (`paths.ymmsl` in the run directory); the actor uses its `md_uri`
default. Run (2 cores, ~3 min):

    ./run_plasmaless_muscle3.sh

Run directory (MUSCLE3 logs only, printed at the end):
`/scratch/users/$USER/plasmaless/m3_standalone_<date>`. The results file
`plasmaless_muscle3_results.mat` (repository root, ignored by git) has the
`run_plasmaless_imas.m` layout (`time`, `Ia`, `Ie`, `Y`, `coil_names`, `loop_names`,
`y_names`; `Y` holds the observables read back from `equilibrium_in`, NaN where absent).
With a linear model directory as first argument (`./run_plasmaless_muscle3.sh <dir>`)
the script sets `plasmaless.linear_model_dir` and writes
`plasmaless_muscle3_linear_results.mat`. With the default `operating_point: descriptor`
and the received model, the operating point is the descriptor's (coil currents of the
linearisation point, voltages 0, rmag/zmag/Ip known) and the saved `Ia` and the
`rmag`/`zmag`/`Ip` columns of `Y` are absolute values (operating point + deviation), the
same as `run_plasmaless_imas.m` with dt 0.01 (except the first row, t0, which the driver
fills with its own cold-start 0 and F_INIT ip 0); the driver's cold-start pf_active
(currents 0, pulse-train voltages at t0) and F_INIT equilibrium (ip 0) are not used
because the descriptor gives everything they carry. With `operating_point: f_init`
(uncomment it in `plasmaless_standalone.ymmsl` or add it to `paths.ymmsl`) the
operating point becomes the driver's: currents 0, `op.voltage` = u(t0) (10 V on CS3U, so
the first pulse is seen as 0 V and the later ones as -10 V), Ip known as 0, rmag/zmag
from the descriptor. To plot it with `plot_plasmaless_model.m`, load it in
MATLAB from the repository root and build the variables that script uses:
`load('plasmaless_muscle3_results.mat'); out.simout = timeseries([Ia Ie], time);`
`tstart = time(1); tend = time(end); TS = timeseries_plasmaless_model(tstart,tend,time(2)-time(1)); plot_plasmaless_model`.
With the same dt, the currents equal those of `run_plasmaless_imas.m`.
